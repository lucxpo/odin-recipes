    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This salmon tartare is a beautifully simple preparation of raw salmon that is a celebration of freshness! The thing I love about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice that causes a cooked texture on the surface of the fish whilst leaving the center rare and soft. Serve with buttered crusty brown toast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) very fresh salmon fillet</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced shallot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced cornichon (small pickled cucumber)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove salmon skin and cut out the grey-colored bloodline so you have only the shiny pink flesh. Cut salmon into small cubes and place in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in shallot, parsley, chives, pickle, lemon juice, sea salt, and pepper. Let marinate for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
